README - GIS F2E ArcGIS Desktop - GIS Features to Edge List Tool (2D and 3D OSM version)

GISF2E allows users to convert line features to networks edgelists. It works with OpenStreetMap data to create non-planar graphs and any other data source to create planar graphs.


*********NOTE: Only the file GISF2E_ArcGIS_v2.10.tbx is needed to work in ArcGIS, but the code is included for your information*********

Changelog:

version 2.10: In this version, GISF2E was updated to work with ArcGIS version 10.7.1.

version 2.00: In this version, we updated GISF2E to work with arcpy (code supplied but not needed to work in ArcGIS). We also updated the inputs needed for the tool to work to only Data Workspace and input street file. If the input streets file includes tunnel AND bridge fields with either 0,1 or True False values, the produced graph will be non-planar, if those fields do not exists, the tool will now produce a planar graph. The output edges, nodes, and edgelist will be produced in the data workspace folder. The tool now removes nodes with the degree of two that are basically artifacts not really needed for analysis. As a result, the tool now produce a cleaner graph.

version 1.10: In this version we fixed some bugs regarding the file path names and outputs. Based on many feedback from our users, We also changed the tool to output a non-directed edgelist with only one row for each edge as our edgelists do not include information related to directed graphs. Users who need to include such information can modify the model to adapt to their specific needs.

version 1.00: First version of GISF2E that creates an edgelist from openStreetMaps data. This version outputs a directed edgelist with two rows for each edge. This would allow for inclusion of edge information such as oneway or lane speeds.
